There are a few things in here (not much).

a) Some C code that I wrote just to reacquaint myself.  

b) some code in python that is more or less geared toward some of the problems on the project euler website

c) yeah, there used to be something else here. I'm going to move it till it's finished.

d) A couple small pieces of Python that I wrote for the qualification round of Google Code Jam this year.
