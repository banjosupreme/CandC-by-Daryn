There are a few things in here (not much).

a) Some C code that I wrote just to reacquaint myself.  

b) some code in python that is more or less geared toward some of the problems on the project euler website

c) a php script for a game that I've been working on. Actually I had it working for Champions League in the spring and I recently broke it modifying it for the nfl season. Nothing major, I just need to sit down one weekend for a couple hours and sort it out but I haven't really had a good weekend to allocate to it in a while. It's just supposed to be a game for my friends and I to play right now.

d) A couple small pieces of Python that I wrote for the qualification round of Google Code Jam this year.
